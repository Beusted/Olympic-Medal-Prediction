# Olympic-Medal-Prediction

Step 1) Hypothesis:
We can predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics.

Step 2) Find the data:
Info:
using athletes and prev. medal columns to predict actual medals

Step 3) Reshape data:
not much need for reshaping

Step 4) Cleaning data:
some cells contains missing values

Step 5) Finding error metric:
predictions will be different from actual medal counts, need way to figure out of prediction is good or not by using mean absolute error (MEA)
errors would be actual medal count vs predictions
comparing error to MEA to see if the predictions are off or not

Step 6) Split data
training data, test data

Step 7) training the model
using linear regression
using 2 predictors (bivariate?)
y = a1x1 + a2x2 + B
